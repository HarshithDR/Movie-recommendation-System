# Movie Recommendation System

**Movie Recommendation System** is a content-based recommendation engine built to provide personalized movie suggestions by analyzing movie metadata such as genres, actors, keywords, and plot descriptions. The system uses machine learning techniques to compute similarity between movies, enabling users to receive movie recommendations tailored to their preferences.

This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, cleaning, and machine learning model implementation. It also includes advanced visualizations to analyze trends and insights in the movie dataset, showcasing the relationships between features such as genres and popularity.

## Key Features

1. **Content-Based Filtering**:  
   - Recommends movies by analyzing metadata such as genres, keywords, actors, and plot summaries.  
   - Employs cosine similarity to calculate the relationship between movies.  

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Performed extensive cleaning of raw data to handle missing and inconsistent values.  
   - Preprocessed metadata to extract meaningful features for accurate recommendations.  

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Used **Seaborn** to create advanced visualizations, revealing insights into movie trends and relationships between features.  

4. **Machine Learning Implementation**:  
   - Built using **Scikit-learn** for similarity computations and efficient implementation of the recommendation engine.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**:  
   - Raw movie data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Metadata such as genres, actors, and plot descriptions are transformed into tokens for analysis.

2. **Similarity Calculation**:  
   - Uses cosine similarity to compute relationships between movies based on their metadata.  
   - The similarity matrix is used to recommend movies similar to a given title.

3. **Visualization and Insights**:  
   - Advanced visualizations created with **Seaborn** to explore trends in genres, popularity, and other features.  

4. **Recommendations**:  
   - Based on a userâ€™s chosen movie, the system recommends a list of movies that are most similar by analyzing metadata.
